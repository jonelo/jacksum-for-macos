Release Notes
-------------
2.0.0, Sep 17, 2023
- bundled Jacksum 3.7.0, and HashGarten 0.14.0
- files/directories are passed from Finder to HashGarten (which is a graphical user
  interface for Jacksum), and from HashGarten to Jacksum so we only have five menu entries
  under the Jacksum script directory. With that change the user experience is the same
  as it is on GNU/Linux and Microsoft Windows.
