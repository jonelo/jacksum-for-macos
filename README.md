# Jacksum for macOS

![Jacksum for macOS app](https://github.com/jonelo/jacksum-for-macos/assets/10409423/d1ed6f5d-59eb-4329-a8c6-1b884df90ff6)

## Abstract

Jacksum for macOS is an installation program with which you can easily access functions of [Jacksum](https://github.com/jonelo/jacksum) on macOS.
In other words, it adds more than 480 hash algorithms to your Mac and you can use them with different user interfaces to calculate hash values, verify data integrity, and many moree. See the [Jacksum](https://github.com/jonelo/jacksum) page for more info.

The installation program installs

- [Jacksum](https://github.com/jonelo/jacksum) which is the hash engine, it also provides the command line interface (CLI)
- [HashGarten](https://github.com/jonelo/HashGarten) which is a standalone graphical user interface (GUI) for Jacksum
- script glue to call Jacksum and HashGarten from your preferred file manager

See also the [Architeture](https://github.com/jonelo/jacksum/wiki/Architecture) of interaction between those components.


## System Requirements

### Hardware

- Intel Mac (x64) or Apple silicon (aarch64)
- 150 MiB disk space

### Software

- macOS 10.11 (El Capitan) or later, tested up to macOS 14.4.1 (Sonoma)
- optional: a supported file manager (see below) to call Jacksum and HashGarten from your flie manager

#### Supported File Managers

**Finder** which supports the Apple Script Menu is fully supported by this integration program. In adddition to that, some file managers providing proprietary interfaces are also supported.

> [!TIP]
> If your preferred file manager does not support the Apple Script Menu, nor allow to use any external scripts nor support any plug-ins, chances are high that your file manager supports at least **drag & drop**, so you could use drag & drop to transfer file/directory-paths from your file manager to the HashGarten GUI where you can process data further, e. g. calculate hashes from file/directory-paths.

The following File Managers have been tested successfully to work with Jacksum and HashGarten:

## Installation

#### 1. Download and open the .dmg

Download and open the [.dmg](https://github.com/jonelo/jacksum-for-macos/releases/latest).

#### 2. Open on the .app

Control-click on the app icon, and choose Open from the shortcut menu. Gatekeeper warns you about the app, but gives you the option to bypass its default policy and open the app.

<p><br/></p>

> [!TIP]
> **For users of macOS Sequoia 15.0 and later**
> 
> With the release of macOS Sequoia any app from an unidentified developer gives an error that the app ist not opened. To open any of such apps, open "System Settings", and go to the "Privacy & Securtiy" tab. On the "Privacy & Security" page scroll down to last. Under the Security section you have an option to open the app that was blocked. Click on the "Open Anyway" button to open it, and proceed with the prompts. Your app will be opened.
>
> To allow open apps on macOS from anywhere, open a Terminal and enter `sudo spctl --master-disable`. Under the "Allow applications from" in the Security section you will find a new menu item called "Anywhere".

Alternatively, you can open a Terminal to bypass the graphical installation program and run the script directly that is bundled with the installer app. Example for Jacksum 3.7.0:

```
% cd /Volumes/Jacksum\ for\ macOS
% ./Jacksum\ 3.7.0\ for\ macOS.app/Contents/Resources/script
```

#### 3. Check results

At the end of the task a summary will tell you what file managers have been found and where Jacksum and HashGarten have been integrated.

## Developers Notes

### How to create the .app and .dmg

#### 1. Download and install the Platypus command line tool

The .app will be created by the Platypus command line tool. Platypus is a great tool create Mac apps from command line scripts.
Go to https://sveinbjorn.org/platypus, download and open Platypus, select "Settings..." from the Platypus menu and install the command line tool.

#### 2. Clone the sources

Clone or download the sources from the GitHub project:
```
% git clone https://github.com/jonelo/jacksum-for-macos.git
% cd jacksum-for-macos/
```

Note: if you haven't installed git yet, Apple's Install Command Line Developer Tools will install it for you.

#### 3. Build both the .app and the .dmg

Open a Terminal and run
```
% ./bin/make_all.sh
```
That will build the .app and wrap it in a .dmg. You find both the .app and the .dmg in the folder called `./output/`.

#### 4. Open the .dmg and test the .app

```
% open ./output/*.dmg
```

### Interna of the installation app

The core of the Jacksum for macOS.app is a bash script that installs both HashGarten and Jacksum to the Finder's Script Menu (and other file managers it can detect) by creating applescript scripts (in case of Finder and Path Finder), and compiling those on the system during the installation using osacompile.

The installation script requires Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) or later to run. The script does not require admin privileges.
Credits: the installer app has been created by [Platypus](https://sveinbjorn.org/platypus), a great app to wrap shell scripts into a macOS app.

Once the script has been compiled by Platypus, the installer app requires macOS 10.11 or later.
The script source can be revealed again by typing
```
% cd /Volumes/Jacksum\ for\ macOS/
% cat ./Jacksum\ 3.7.0\ for\ macOS.app/Contents/Resources/script
```

The source code of the generated and compiled applescripts can be relealed again by opening the .scpt files (located in the appropriate sccript folders) usiing the
Apple Script Editor or osadecompile.
